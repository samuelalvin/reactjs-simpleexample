# Initial Setup of a web app using ReactJs
this is the minimum requirement to use ReactJs in a web app. To start this code, npm is required. [npm is included when node.js is installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). After npm is installed, download this branch, and type these in the terminal at the application directory:
```
npm install
npm start
```
